# DETECTION-AND-PREVENTION-OF-MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE-ATTACKS-BY-ACTIVE-ARP-MONITORING
Man in the Middle attack or ARP spoofing allows an attacker to intercept data frames on a network, modify the traffic, or stop all traffic. In this attack, an attacker sits between a target computer and the gateway(usually the router), so every packet of data going from the gateway to the target computer passes through the attacker and vice-versa. In this project, we are going to make a Linux bash script to detect the presence of a third party (man in the middle) in a network. By doing so we can prevent Man in the Middle attacks.
